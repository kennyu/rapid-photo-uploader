		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Backend Project Setup with Spring Boot and DDD Structure",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the backend setup into subtasks covering: project scaffolding, DDD folder structure, CQRS handler separation, MapStruct integration, Gradle/Maven configuration, and health endpoint implementation.",
			"reasoning": "This task requires advanced architectural decisions (DDD, CQRS, VSA), modular code organization, and integration of several frameworks. It involves significant cognitive complexity due to the need for clear separation of concerns, maintainability, and future extensibility. Testing must validate both structure and basic functionality, increasing implementation effort and requiring multiple dependencies and configuration steps[1][2][3]."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Cloud Object Storage Integration (AWS S3/Azure Blob)",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose cloud storage integration into: SDK setup, credential management, pre-signed URL generation, file upload/download logic, and multipart upload support.",
			"reasoning": "Integrating with cloud storage involves handling external SDKs, secure credential management, and implementing robust upload/download flows. Supporting multipart uploads and pre-signed URLs adds technical complexity, especially for large files and concurrency. Testing must cover various edge cases and security aspects[1][2]."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Web Client Project Setup (React + TypeScript)",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand web client setup into: project scaffolding, linting/formatting configuration, folder structure organization, and React Query integration.",
			"reasoning": "While modern tooling (CRA, Vite) simplifies initial setup, enforcing strict TypeScript, linting, and feature-based architecture requires careful configuration. Integrating React Query for state management adds some complexity but follows standard patterns. Testing is straightforward but must ensure all tools are correctly wired[1][6]."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Mobile Client Project Setup (React Native)",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide mobile client setup into: project initialization (Expo/bare), TypeScript config, linting/formatting, navigation setup, and folder structure organization.",
			"reasoning": "React Native setup is more involved than web due to platform-specific requirements (iOS/Android), navigation configuration, and parity with web architecture. Ensuring smooth builds and code quality across platforms increases complexity, though industry tooling mitigates some effort[1][6]."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Upload Job Status Tracking and Retry Logic",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split status tracking into: database schema updates, event-driven status updates, retry logic implementation, exponential backoff configuration, integration with S3 notifications/polling, and test coverage for failure scenarios.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves asynchronous event handling, robust error/retry logic, and integration with external systems (S3 events). Implementing exponential backoff and ensuring accurate status transitions require careful design and thorough testing, increasing both cognitive and cyclomatic complexity[1][2][5]."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Database Schema Design and PostgreSQL Integration",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down schema design into: entity modeling, migration script creation, ORM integration, UUID key setup, and CRUD repository implementation.",
			"reasoning": "Designing a relational schema with proper relationships, migrations, and ORM integration is moderately complex. Using UUIDs and ensuring referential integrity adds some technical depth, but follows established patterns. Testing must verify both schema and data access logic[1][3]."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 15,
			"taskTitle": "End-to-End Integration Testing (Backend, Web, Mobile)",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand E2E testing into: backend integration tests (JUnit/Testcontainers), web E2E tests (Cypress), mobile E2E tests (Detox/Appium), test data setup, batch upload simulation, status polling verification, and gallery retrieval validation.",
			"reasoning": "Coordinating integration tests across backend, web, and mobile clients is highly complex due to multiple environments, data flows, and concurrency. Simulating real-world scenarios and ensuring coverage for all critical paths requires significant effort and expertise[1][7]."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Image Processing and Compression Service",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose image service into: compression logic, AI tagging integration, asynchronous processing setup, metadata update, and performance/resource testing.",
			"reasoning": "Implementing efficient image compression and integrating AI tagging involves external dependencies, asynchronous processing, and resource management. Ensuring scalability and correctness adds complexity, especially for large batches and varied image types[1][2]."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Authentication and Authorization (JWT-Based)",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide authentication into: login endpoint, JWT issuance/validation, securing endpoints, password hashing/storage, and mock authentication setup.",
			"reasoning": "Implementing secure authentication with JWTs, password hashing, and endpoint protection is technically demanding and security-critical. Mocking for local development and handling token edge cases adds further complexity[1][2]."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 16,
			"taskTitle": "Deployment Pipeline Setup (CI/CD for All Components)",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down CI/CD setup into: backend pipeline, web pipeline, mobile pipeline, test automation, deployment configuration (AWS/Azure), and environment management.",
			"reasoning": "Automating build, test, and deployment for multiple components across cloud platforms requires deep knowledge of CI/CD tools, environment configuration, and integration points. Ensuring reliability and security across all stages increases complexity[1][6]."
